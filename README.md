# Youtube Simplifier

This is a very simple script to redirect the youtube home page to the subscriptions page.
It can also remove the download, share, clip and thanks buttons.
To configure this, edit the config object at the top of the script.

This relies on [Enhancer for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhancer-for-youtube/ponfpcnoihfmfllpaingbgckeeldkhle).

To use this, copy the main.js contents into the "Custom script" section of the Enhancer for Youtube settings.
